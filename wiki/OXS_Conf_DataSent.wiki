When clicking on this button, the Configurator will perform a number of verifications and will warn you if there is a problem with your settings.

The file destination is determined by the [OXS_Configuration#OXS_directory OXS directory] setting. If it's not defined, the file will be written to the root of the Configurator executable folder.
