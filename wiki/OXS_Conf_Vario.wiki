==Vario settings==

One or two *[OXS_Build_Vario MS5611 barometric sensor]* can be connected to OXS and provide altitude and vertical speed data.

===RC remote functionalities===

If the checkbox "PPM" is ticked, you will be able to control some parameters from your transmitter during the flight, using a switch and/or a potentiometer and a servo channel:
  * changing vario sensitivity
  * switching V.Speed type (more below)

In this case, a receiver signal servo pin has to be connected to the Arduino pin chosen in the PPM Pin dropdown list.


  * PPM range Min. = the minimum value of the ppm input (pulse length in microseconds ). (Standard OpenTX value is 988)
  * PPM range Max. = the maximum value of the ppm input (pulse length in microseconds ). (Standard OpenTX value is 2012)

_Note: This PPM section is shared between Vario and Air Speed sensors._

The PPM range for sensitivity parameters define the PPM range in which you will be able to adjust the sensitivity value:
  * PPM range for sensitivity Min. = When Tx sends this value on the PPM channel, Sensitivity Min. (see below) will be replaced by PPM sensitivity Min.
  * PPM range for sensitivity Max. = When Tx sends this value on the PPM channel, Sensitivity Max. (see below) will be replaced by PPM sensitivity Max.
  
The PPM sensitivity parameters define the sensitivity range in which you will be able to adjust the sensitivity value:
  * PPM sensitivity Min. = the sensitivity minimum value that can be assigned using PPM. (Standard value could be 20)
  * PPM sensitivity Max. = the sensitivity maximum value that can be assigned using PPM. (Standard value could be 100)

_Note : When Arduino detects a signal from TX, the parameters for the predefined sensitivity are automatically discarded and replaced by PPM sensitivity._

_Important note : Sensitivity is changed based on the absolute value of PPM, so PPM = -25 has the same effect as PPM = 25. This is important in order to combine change in sensitivity with a switch on TX to select the V.Speed type switching._

The V.Speed type switching parameters let you choose what will be sent to TX between 2 among 3 different V.Speed calculations when you select "PPM V.Speed" in the OXS measurement list:
  # Vario 1        --> first ms5611
  # Vario 2        --> second ms5611
  # V1 + A.Speed   --> first ms5611 + Air Speed sensor compensation => vario with total energy compensation

_Note : When not using PPM option, the first dropdown list remains active to let you choose the unique V.Speed type._

The PPM V.Speed switching parameters define the PPM range in which you will be able to select the V.Speed type:

When the ABSOLUTE value of PPM is between PPM V.Speed switching Min. and PPM V.Speed switching Max.
  * OXS will switch to the first V.Speed type if  *PPM is POSITIVE*
  * OXS will switch to the second V.Speed type if  *PPM is NEGATIVE*
  
_Note: When the absolute value of PPM is outside this range, OXS will not switch between V.Speed type and keep the current one. This principle allows to use a switch on TX simultaneously with a pot, in order to control sensitivity *and* compensation._

_Switching from positive to negative can be achieved on OpenTX with a mixer using MULTIPLY with weight -100%._

_Sending a PPM value outside this range lets to instruct OXS to apply another order (e.g. resetting the airspeed offset), without switching the V.Speed type._

===Sensitivity===

https://openxsensor.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/OXSC_vario_04.png

Sensitivity can be set between:
  * 20 (conservative setting, reaction time = several seconds)
  * 150 (fast but lot of errors, reaction time = much less than a second)
  
50 is a standard setting when measuring small vertical speed (search for lift with a glider).

!OpenXsensor allows to automatically modify the sensitivity depending on the vertical speed:
  * Sensitivity Min. = sensitivity value being used when vertical speed is lower than Sensitivity interpolated switching Min. (Standard value = 40)
  * Sensitivity Max. = sensitivity value being used when vertical speed is higher than Sensitivity interpolated switching Max. (Standard value = 100)

Sensitivity Max. can be set equal to Min. when higher sensitivity for high vertical speed is unwanted.

  * Sensitivity interpolated switching (cm/s) Min. --> Sensitivity Min. applies when vertical speed is lower than this value. (Standard value = 20)
  * Sensitivity interpolated switching (cm/s) Max. --> Sensitivity Max. applies when vertical speed is higher than this value. (Standard value = 100)

Sensitivity is automatically interpolated between Sensitivity interpolated switching Min. and Sensitivity interpolated switching Max.

===Hysteresis===

https://openxsensor.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/OXSC_vario_05.png

OXS can also apply some hysteresis on vertical speed changes.

This parameter allows to avoid that transmitted vertical speed changes too often (which can result in bad sound alerts).

It means that transmitted vertical speed will change only if measured vertical speed (after filtering) differs from previous transmitted value by more than the Hysteresis value. (Standard value can be 5 (5 cm/s), 0 means no hysteresis)

===Analog climb rate===

https://openxsensor.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/OXSC_vario_06.png

OXS can also deliver the vertical speed as an analog signal that has to be connected to A1 or A2 on D series receivers.

This can be useful if you have a receiver that has no digital communication pin (D6FR) or if it is already used by another sensor.

*! Additional Hardware is required !*     --     Please read [OXS_Build_Vario#With_optional_analog_climb_rate_output Analog Climb Rate option].

To activate this feature, tick the Analog climb rate checkbox and choose the Pin in the dropdown list.

Then set the Min. and Max. climb rate values (Range (m/s)) that you want to output to the receiver.

  * Range Min. value or lower will apply 0 V to the receiver analog pin (A1 or A2).
  * Range Max. value or higher will apply 3.2 V to the receiver analog pin (A1 or A2).
